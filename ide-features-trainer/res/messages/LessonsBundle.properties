js.editor.basics.module.name=Editor Basics
js.editor.basics.module.description=Get the hang of the editor essentials \u2013 start writing better code and saving time on common tasks from day one.

js.editor.completion.title=Code Completion
js.editor.completion.choose.lookup=<ide/> is full of features that help you write better code and increase your productivity.\
  Let\u2019s start with code completion. It enables you to code faster by completing keywords and symbols from language APIs and project \
  dependencies. Type {0} and hit {1} to autocomplete {2}.
js.editor.completion.choose.method=So, code completion shows context-aware suggestions as you type. \
  To add one of these suggestions, you can use {0} like we just did, or press {1} to replace an existing item. \
  Now add a {2} after {3}, then type {4} and autocomplete the {5} method with {0}.
js.editor.completion.parameter.info=The tooltip ({0}) we\u2019ve got after placing the caret inside {1} lets you quickly look up the names of \
  parameters in methods and functions. In some situations, you may want to review more detailed documentation. Let\u2019s do it now by pressing {2}.
js.editor.completion.add.parameter=This is how you can look up JavaScript documentation right in <ide/>. Now add {0} inside {1} to continue.
js.editor.completion.console.log.argument=Finally, let\u2019s complete the {0} statement. \
  Place the caret inside {1} on the line 8 and add {2} using code completion.
js.editor.completion.next=That\u2019s it for this lesson. To start the next one, click the button below or use {0}.

js.editor.code.editing.tips.and.tricks.title=Code Editing Tips and Tricks
js.editor.code.editing.reformat.start=Let''s go over some tips and tricks that can help you edit code a lot faster. \
  For starters, there''s no need to manually fix code formatting with <ide/>. Reformat the code with {0}.
js.editor.code.editing.select.word=That\u2019s it! Now let\u2019s see how to quickly select pieces of code in a file. \
  Press {0} a few times to fully select the second tr element (lines 14-18).
js.editor.code.editing.comment.delete.unselect.move.up=Now that you''ve selected the code, you can (un)comment it out ({0}), delete it \
  ({1}), or shrink the selection ({2}).\nAnother thing you can do is move this code up or down the file. Let\u2019s move it up with {3}.
js.editor.code.editing.multi.caret=Next up is multi-caret editing. Use it to save a bunch of time as you modify code in several spots at once. \
  Place the caret inside the first {0} tag (line 10). Then select all {1} tags inside the same tr element (lines 10-12): press {2} six \
  times until all the necessary tags are selected. \nLet''s replace {3} with {4} and hit {5} to exit the multi-caret mode.
js.editor.code.editing.duplicate.delete.comment=Finally, let\u2019s quickly try the most popular line actions, such as duplicate line, \
  delete line, or comment it out. Use {0} to duplicate the selected line now. Then hit {1} and {2} to try the other line actions.
js.editor.code.editing.next=That''s it for this lesson. Click the button below to start the next one or use  {0}.

js.editor.code.inspection.title=The Power of Code Inspections
js.editor.code.inspection.intro=As you work in the editor, <ide/> constantly analyzes your code, detects various problems in it, and suggests \
  how it can be improved. The opened file has two highlighted problems on lines 4 and 5. Let\u2019s check what they are by pressing {0}.
js.editor.code.inspection.show.intentions=You can also use {0} to jump from one error to another. \
  Or, you can explore the found problems by hovering over them.\n\
  In this file, the IDE has located an unresolved variable \u2013 one that wasn''t defined anywhere in the code. \
  It suggests creating a new one, {1}, as one of the possible fixes, but we need to add a parameter book instead. \
  Place the caret on {2} and hit {3} to see the full list of fixes.
js.editor.code.inspection.run.intention=Let\u2019s select {0} and press {1}.
js.editor.code.inspection.checkmark=If you now look at the top right-hand corner of the editor, you\u2019ll see a green checkmark ({0}) \
  confirming the file has no more problems. However, there\u2019s still a minor detail that can be optimized to make the code shorter. \
  Place the caret on {1} (line 3) and press {2}.
js.editor.code.inspection.make.shorter=Now let\u2019s make our function expression shorter. Select the {0} quick-fix and hit {1}.
js.editor.code.inspection.next=That\u2019s it for this lesson. Click the button below to start the next one or use  {0}.

js.editor.navigation.title=Efficient Navigation
js.editor.navigation.recent.files=Let\u2019s start with navigating around a project. Press {0} to call up the {1} popup.
js.editor.navigation.choose.structure=With this popup, you can quickly jump between recent files and IDE tool windows. One of those tool \
  windows can assist you with navigating around a smaller piece of a project, a single file. Click the {0} tab to learn more about it.
js.editor.navigation.activate.structure=So, the {0} tool window can help you examine a file faster. It provides an overview of its \
  structure and lets you jump to a specific item simply by typing its name. Start typing {1} anywhere in the tool window area, hit {2}, \
  and then hit {3} to close the panel and jump to the code.
js.editor.navigation.find.usages=As a result of our actions, the caret has moved to {0} (line 9). \
  Let\u2019s leave it there and press {1} to open another tool window that can help you quickly find usages of any item.
js.editor.navigation.hide.tool.window=Great! Now you can see the usages of giveTreat across the whole project and the libraries. \
  Let\u2019s close the tool window with {0}.
js.editor.navigation.search.everywhere=Now press {0} twice to meet another feature that can help you search faster.
js.editor.navigation.search.everywhere.tabs=This is the {0} popup. It lets you instantly find any action, file, class or symbol, and shows \
  all the matches in one place. If you want to run a more specific search, you can hit {1} to switch from {2} to any other tab, such as \
  {3} or {4}. Or you can use a shortcut to open a specific tab that you need. Let\u2019s try the latter with {5}.
js.editor.navigation.search.action=Now that we\u2019re on the {0} tab, let\u2019s start typing {1} in the search bar to look up a shortcut for \
  another useful navigation feature.
js.editor.navigation.go.to.declaration=Notice the {0} next to <strong>Go to Declaration or Usages</strong> \u2013 it shows you usages for the \
  definition and vice versa. Let\u2019s close the popup, place the caret on {1} (line 16), and hit {0} to look for its declaration.
js.editor.navigation.keymap.reference=Congratulations! You\u2019ve made it to the end of {0}. Print out the <a href="{1}">keymap reference</a> \
  to have all the shortcuts handy as you make yourself at home in <ide/>. Click the button below to move to the next module.

js.editor.refactorings.title=Refactorings in a Nutshell
js.editor.refactorings.this=<ide/> has a <a href=''{0}''>number of refactorings</a> that can automatically restructure existing code without \
  changing its behavior across the entire project. Let''s look up the list of refactorings available for the {1} parameter. \
  To do this, press {2} or go to {3} from the main menu.
js.editor.refactorings.rename=With {0}, you don''t need to memorize all the refactorings the IDE has, or their shortcuts. \
  Let''s click {1} to see one of the most popular refactorings in action.
js.editor.refactorings.rename.apply=Rename the {0} parameter to {1} and hit {2}. This will apply the changes across all files in the project.
js.editor.refactorings.shortcut=Well done! Let''s try refactoring code the other way \u2013 by using a shortcut. \
  Place the caret on the {0} property (line 4) and press {1}.
js.editor.refactoring.replace=Now replace all 2 occurrences with the {0} variable named {1}.
js.editor.refactoring.select.expression=Let''s create a new variable, {0}, which will contain {1}. \
  Select the {1} expression from the list and hit {2}.
js.editor.refactorings.next=We''ve just explored two ways to refactor code in <ide/>. Print out the <a href="{0}">keymap reference</a> \
  if you prefer using shortcuts, or simply keep using the {1} menu. Click the button below to start the next lesson or use {2}.

js.getting.started.module.name=Getting Started with Testing
js.getting.started.module.description=Find out how to streamline unit testing in {0} by going through an example using Jest.

js.testing.jest.title=Fundamentals of Testing in {0}
js.testing.jest.prepare=With <ide/>, all testing workflows become easier. Let\u2019s see how. For this module, we\u2019ll use \
  <a href="{0}">Jest</a> and one of <a href="{1}">its sample projects</a> as an example, so please make sure you have Jest and npm/Yarn \
  installed on your machine (see <a href="{2}">this</a> webpage for more information). We\u2019ll start by creating a run/debug configuration, \
  which is going to be Jest-specific. On the main menu, select {3} > {4}. Then click {5}, add the {6} configuration with the default \
  parameters, and hit {7} to save it.
js.testing.jest.run=So, now the new {0} configuration is selected by default. Let\u2019s click the {1} ({2}) button right next to it.
js.testing.jest.navigate=Now we can see the {0} tool window with the test results and a stack trace for the failed tests coming from a \
  test runner in it. Apart from simply tracking the test progress, you can do a lot of other things here. You can rerun all ({1}) or only \
  failed ({2}) tests, view passed tests ({3}), or enable the <a href="{4}">watch mode</a> to automatically rerun tests on changes.\n\
  You can also quickly find a specific test in {5}. Let\u2019s try it now: place the caret anywhere in the {5} area, type {6}, and press {7} \
  to jump to our test.
js.testing.jest.double.click=That\u2019s it! Use this feature whenever you need to quickly find your way through a lot of tests. \
  Let\u2019s now double-click {0} that we\u2019ve found.
js.testing.jest.fix.test=By double-clicking a test in {0}, we\u2019ve jumped straight to its location in the code. If you now hover over {1}, \
  you\u2019ll see a popup explaining why the test failed. From there, you can also debug a test if needed.\n\
  Let\u2019s now replace the incorrect value used for {2}: on line 6, replace {3} with {4}.
js.testing.jest.re.run.test=Now that we have the right value for the expected result, we can rerun our test. Let\u2019s do it in a different \
  way this time. See the {0} icon on the left of the test in the editor? This icon not only shows you the test status for the tests you\u2019ve \
  run recently, but also lets you quickly run and debug a specific test.\nLet\u2019s click it and select {1}.
js.testing.jest.success.run.coverage=Great job! Our test has successfully passed.\nLet\u2019s take a look at another handy tool. \
  Click the {0} icon located next to the run/debug configurations menu.
js.testing.jest.coverage.result=This is how you can quickly build a code coverage report showing how many files were covered with tests, \
  including the percentage of lines that were covered in those files. Now let\u2019s close the coverage report with {0}.
js.testing.jest.end=Congratulations! You\u2019ve made it to the end of this module. Most of what we\u2019ve learned also applies to the other test \
  runners that <ide/> supports (except for code coverage and the watch mode). For more tips and tricks about testing apps with Jest, please \
  take a look at <a href="{0}">this</a> blog post. If you use other test runners, you may want to explore our <a href="{1}">web help</a>.

js.debugger.module.name={0} Debugger 101
js.debugger.module.description=Learn how to run a program step by step and identify problems in it without leaving the IDE.

js.debugger.before.title=Before Debugging: Run/Debug Configurations
js.debugger.before.intro=With <ide/>, you can run and debug all kinds of JavaScript apps right where you write your code.\nIn this module, \
  we\u2019ll go over some steps that will be helpful no matter what kind of code you debug. In our case, it will be a very basic \
  <a href=''{0}''>Node.js</a> app that should compare two numbers and return {1} or {2}. Please make sure Node.js is \
  <a href=''{3}''>installed</a> on your machine before moving forward (for a fresh install, you\u2019ll need to restart <ide/>). \
  Hit {4} if you\u2019re ready to continue.
js.debugger.before.describe.tool.window=Two things happened as we hit {0}. First, we ran a file using Node.js and opened the {1} \
  tool window, which shows the results of running the code. Second, <ide/> created a temporary run/debug configuration so we could run a file \
  like that. Let\u2019s hide the tool window with {2} for now and get to know run/debug configurations better.
js.debugger.before.save=So, these configurations serve as an entry point to running/debugging apps. They can be temporary or permanent. \
  The main difference is that temporary ones are automatically deleted if the default limit of 5 configurations is reached.\nLet\u2019s see how \
  you can turn a temporary configuration into a permanent one. Open the {0} drop-down menu located in the top right-hand corner and select {1}.
js.debugger.before.edit=That\u2019s it! Now, what if you want to adjust the settings of this new run/debug configuration or use another one? \
  Open the {0} menu again and click {1}.
js.debugger.before.manage=This is a place for managing run/debug configurations. To add a new one, hit {0}, select the desired \
  configuration type, and specify the settings based on your project/configuration type. To fine-tune an existing one, you can click its \
  name and update what\u2019s needed.\nTake some time to explore what can be found here and close the window once you\u2019re ready to move next.
js.debugger.before.next=That\u2019s it for this lesson. To start the next one, click the button below or use {0}.

js.debugger.part.1.title=Debugging Code. Part I
js.debugger.part.1.start=Now that we have a run/debug configuration in place, let\u2019s see how to work with the built-in debugger.\n\
  First, let\u2019s run our code one more time to examine what it returns as we didn''t focus on this in the previous lesson. \
  Click the {0} button located next to the drop-down with configurations to run the currently selected one.
js.debugger.part.1.gutter=The numbers we\u2019re comparing, {0} and {1}, are not equal, so we should\u2019ve got {2} when running the code. \
  Let\u2019s find out why we got {3} instead. On line 1, click the left editor gutter (empty space) between #1 and the code to put a breakpoint.
js.debugger.part.1.set.breakpoint=So, we can use breakpoints to pause the execution of the app. The red circle you see on the left-hand \
  editor gutter is what a breakpoint looks like in <ide/>. If you click on it again, it will be removed. You can also right-click on it \
  to customize its behavior, e.g. set a condition for it. Let\u2019s hit the {0} button located at the top right-hand corner (or press {1}) to move next.
js.debugger.part.1.tool.window=Meet the {0} tool window. On its left side, you can find icons for stopping/rerunning configurations, and \
  managing breakpoints. At its top, you can see a few tabs and a bunch of icons for stepping through the code.\nThe {1} tab we''re on is \
  where most of the work is done. On the right, you can see all the {2} grouped by scopes, along with their values. The {3} view shows the \
  call stack. If you go through it, you\u2019ll see the app state at every point of the execution path. Now switch to the {4} tab.
js.debugger.part.1.scripts.tab=The {0} tab shows the messages logged by an app, including errors. When debugging Node.js apps, <ide/> \
  also shows the {1} tab, where you can run JavaScript code snippets and view the console messages. Switch to the {2} tab to continue.
js.debugger.part.1.next=The {0} tab lists all the files loaded into the currently running process. You can see the content of any file by \
  double-clicking on it. To move to the second part of this lesson, click the button below or use {1}.

js.debugger.part.2.title=Debugging Code. Part II
js.debugger.part.2.step.into=<strong>Important</strong>: Please make sure that there\u2019s a breakpoint on line 1 and that the debugger is \
  launched ({0}) and opened on the {1} tab before moving forward.\nLet''s continue with locating a bug in our code and learn a few more \
  things that come in handy when debugging in <ide/>.To better understand how our code is executed, we could put a few more breakpoints in it \
  and then move from one to another using {2} button ({3}), but there\u2019s a faster way. Let\u2019s step to the next executed line by pressing {4} \
  and using {5} ({6}).
js.debugger.part.2.buttons=To learn more about stepping through the program, check out <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/webstorm/stepping-through-the-program.html">our online help.</a>\
  \nNow, what if we want to check the value of an expression? <ide/> lets you do it quickly with the {6} popup. Press {7} to call it.
js.debugger.part.2.evaluate=Let''s add {0} as an expression and hit {1}. Look at the result: it equals {2}. This is where the problem lies. \
  In order for the function to catch different numbers, we need to slightly change the expression so that its result would equal {3}.\n\
  Now let''s close the popup and fix the problem we''ve found in the code. Inside {4} on line 2, replace {5} with {6}.
js.debugger.part.2.stop=Finally, let\u2019s learn how to stop the debugger when you no longer need it. First, click the breakpoint we added to \
  remove it. Then, stop the debugger with {0} ({1}) and close its tool window by pressing {2}.
js.debugger.part.2.end=Congratulations! You\u2019ve made it to the end of {0} and learned some basic ways to debug all kinds of apps. If you\u2019d \
  like, you can run the code one more time to confirm that everything works fine now. To dive deeper into debugging specific types of apps, \
  take a look at our <a href=''{1}''>web help</a> and <a href=''{2}''>blog posts</a>. Click the button below to move to the next module.

swift.navigation.search.name=Search
swift.navigation.search.intro=Searching in AppCode is different. We have special features for searching text and others dedicated to searching code. This is because code is not mere text - it has a specific structure formed by the code constructs.
swift.navigation.search.var=This sample file has lots of code constructs containing the word {0}. The caret is on the variable named {1}. Press {2} to find all the text occurrences of the word {3}.
swift.navigation.search.find.usages.var=This is not very helpful, is it? In real code, we probably want to search for the {0} variable, without including class names, method names, or any other code constructs. Try pressing {1} and then {2}.
swift.navigation.search.find.usages.var.result=Now, AppCode shows us only actual usages of the {0} variable.
swift.navigation.search.find.usages.proto=The same applies to any other code construct. Press {0} \u2192 {1} to find all the usages of the {2} protocol in the project.
swift.navigation.search.find.usages.method=Now let''s find all usages of the method {0}. Press {1} \u2192 {2} again.
swift.navigation.search.rule=The simple rule is: think which symbol you need to find, instead of which piece of text you need to find. <strong>Find Usages</strong> works for any code construct in the project context, so you will find all the usages in the whole codebase.
swift.navigation.search.text.search=Of course, sometimes you don''t know what exactly you''re looking for, and you want to find as many matches as possible by searching for some text. In this case, use {0} to search in the current file, or use {1} to search in the whole project.
swift.navigation.search.everything=What if you want to search for some text in symbols, file names, or even IDE settings and menu items? Press <shortcut>Double\u21E7</shortcut> to open the <strong>Search Everywhere</strong> dialog.
