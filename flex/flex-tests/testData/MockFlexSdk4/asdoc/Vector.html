  The Vector class lets you access and manipulate a vector &mdash; an array whose elements
  all have the same data type. The data type of a Vector's elements is
  known as the Vector's <i>base type</i>. The base type can be any class,
  including built in classes and custom classes. The base type is specified when
  declaring a Vector variable as well as when creating an instance by calling
  the class constructor.
