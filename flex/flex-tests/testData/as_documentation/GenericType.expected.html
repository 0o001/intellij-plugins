<HTML><PRE><b>Vector</b></PRE>
  The Vector class lets you access and manipulate a vector &mdash; an array whose elements<br>
  all have the same data type. The data type of a Vector's elements is<br>
  known as the Vector's <i>base type</i>. The base type can be any class,<br>
  including built in classes and custom classes. The base type is specified when<br>
  declaring a Vector variable as well as when creating an instance by calling<br>
  the class constructor.
